Objective of the project:-
-Implementing image processing,stochastic geometry and pattern recognition to identify similarities between two given city maps
-Implementing unsupervised algorithm (k-means) to create a cluster of cities with similar pattern and classify them
Implementation:-
- Extraction of important features(like roads,highways) of cities are done on C++ platform by importing OpenCV library. 
 -Hough's transform of image has been used for edge detection and 2-D geometry detection of lines.
- After the extraction of data, k-mean unsupervised algorithm implementation has been done on python. 
-The data set for this include the points that has been extracted from the previous stage of Hough Transformation of the image

Uniqueness of the project:-
-Stochastic geometry has been used widely for wireless network modelling, but this hasn't been the case for pattern recognition oriented for maps.

Technologies involved:-
Language:- C++,Python
Algorithm:- HoughsTransform, k-means unsupervised algorithm
